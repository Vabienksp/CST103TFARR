Who are you and what do you do?
  We are Jackson Labs, we are a leader in biomedical research.
Why are you selling the new product? 
  We currently bus our employees, however with a gap in the electric bus industry, it would be difficult to switch to one. So we have made a new division: Jackson EV.
How do you want the new product to be perceived in a website?
  This product should be seen as innovative in the field. 
What is the single most important thing visitors want from your site? For example: find new products, register for a course, join a mailing list. Note: Try to consider this from the customer's perspective. This is not about what you want for the company, i.e., more sales, but what your visitors want from the site.
  Visitors will want to know about statistics and info on our products, and want a way to contact for purchase.
What is the single most important thing you want to convey on your site? From the perspective of your company/org.
  Our vehicles are better than those made by our competitors, and we lead the technology.
Describe your target audience.

Why should clients chose your products or services over the competition?
  We believe that electric vehicles are the future, and it is our only focus. Our buses range from cheaper and still well made, to more expensive with state-of-the-art technology
How will you judge if this is a successful website?
  If I can hand the site to a random person and they are interested in the EVs, it is a good website.
